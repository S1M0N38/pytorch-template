______________________________________________________________________

There are many components involved in training a PyTorch model, including model
architectures, loss functions, hyperparameters, optimizers, dataloaders, and
all of their arguments.

A standard training loop requires boilerplate code to connect all of
these components, including training and validation steps, saving and loading
checkpoints, and tracking metrics.

To simplify this process, a \[ðŸ”¥\] template can be used to specify the aforementioned
components using a TOML file, while implementing the remaining ones as a minimal class
in a single PyTorch file.

## Usage

1. Define the configuration in a TOML file (e.g. `configs/example.toml`)
1. Train, Validate and Test the model with `python main.py configs/example.toml`

## How it works

A TOML file is read by the `Trainer` class (the unique class that implements all
the boilerplate code for training) and dynamically loads classes and their
arguments using the `init` function:

```python
def init(module: object, class_args: dict):
    class_name = class_args.pop("class")
    return getattr(module, class_name)(**class_args)
```

Suppose the following TOML configuration for the optimizer:

```TOML
[optimizer]
class = "Adam"
lr = 1e-3
weight_decay=0
```

From the `[optimizer]` section, \[ðŸ”¥\] uses the `class` to create a new instance
of a `torch.optim.Adam` optimizer and passes all other values as arguments to the
new object (here `lr` and `weight_decay`). Optimizer also has `parameters` as a
positional argument but this is already provided by the code in the `Learner`
class.

You can also initialize from TOML your custom classes

```TOML
[model]
class = "LeNet5"
num_classes = 10
```

This configuration section will initialize `LeNet5` class defined in `models/models.py`
as the model architecture.

You can easily understand how a TOML file is loaded by `Trainer` and `Tester` by
comparing `configs/example.toml` and `__init__()` methods in `main.py`.

## Q&A

- **Is \[ðŸ”¥\] stable?**
  *No, I'm tweaking this template based on my experience and needs, so expect
  breaking changes. Nevertheless, this is a template so you might have to heavily modify
  it to fit your needs.*

- **Why the name \[ðŸ”¥\]?**
  *It's a combination of the PyTorch flame and the square brackets defining
  sections in a TOML file.*

- **Why TOML?**
  *I think it's simpler than [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) and better
  than [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for configuration. Moreover, the
  Python ecosystem starts to embrace it:
  [tomllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html) in the standard
  library and
  [pyproject.toml](https://snarky.ca/what-the-heck-is-pyproject-toml/) for Python
  project configuration.*
